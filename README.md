# Using Tensorflow for Weather in Image Recognition

Recognising the weather in an outdoor scene from Pi Camera images using Convolutional Neural Networks.

1. Create a virtual environment on your Raspberry Pi.
2. Install Tensorflow.
3. Make sure your Raspberry Pi camera is connected and focused outdoors on an open area.
4. Run `python label_image.py image0`
